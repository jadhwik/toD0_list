This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


ugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a ToDo list created with different idea. The features of the react app are:

1.Different sections of task stattus are added like pending,completed etc...

2.The user can edit some fields like priority,task status.

3.Also local storage is used to store the data which will stay  untill it is deleted.

4.The user can also filter the tasks based on the priority and assignee name.

Edit options:
